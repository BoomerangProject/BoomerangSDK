# Boomerang Smart Contracts
Boomerang is a rewards and performance driven currency built on top of the [Ethereum][ethereum] blockchain. Boomerang is the fastest and easiest way to rate and equitably reward both users and workers. By leveraging the blockchain to achieve complete transparency, Boomerang restores trust in ratings through cryptographically verified transactions that cannot be manipulated by ads or algorithms.

The Boomerang contracts are written in [Solidity][solidity] and tested using [waffle][waffle].

#### Run Tests

```bash
# build contracts
$ yarn build

# run smart contract tests
